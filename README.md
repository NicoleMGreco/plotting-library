# plotting-library
Material and script for the data and software class
plotting-library is a repository that creates a line plot of published grain size data from Forwick showing grain diameter in microns versus concentration.
The data is included in the repository and to run the code you simply change the data name (.csv file) and the output location. The figure will be saved automatically.
Packages needed are included at the beginning of the script.
